  ## Description:
  Budget tracker is an application designed to add and subtract transactions from a balance and be fully functional either on or offline.  The use of indexedDb makes it possible to store the transaction data in a cache in order to automatically update the budget as soon as conectivity resumes.  This exercise also utilized service workers and a formatted manifest.json file.
